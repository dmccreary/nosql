# About The NoSQL Website

I am a retired solution architect with over
40 years experience in the computer industry.  At
the start of my career, I was taught
that only tabular data structures were the  way to store data.

Around the year 2005 I saw an entire generation of
new databases appear but I saw very little guidance
on how to match a business problem to one
of the many new databases.  Working with [Tony Shaw]()
at Enterprise Data World (now Dataversity) I
created an annual conference to showcase the
new database and highlight the core business cases
that they were addressing.

In 2014, working with my wife, we published the book
[Making Sense of NoSQL]().  Ever since then I have
advocated for putting the NoSQL content early in
any computer science curriculum.

My hope is this content helps both teachers and
students gain a clear understanding of the variety
of different ways we store data and the impact these
methods have the competitive nature of the firm.
