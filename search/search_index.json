At the start of my career, I was taught that only tabular data structures were the  way to store data.</p> <p>Around the year 2005 I saw an entire generation of new databases appear but I saw very little guidance on how to match a business problem to one of the many new databases.  Working with Tony Shaw at Enterprise Data World (now Dataversity) I created an annual conference to showcase the new database and highlight the core business cases that they were addressing.</p> <p>In 2014, working with my wife, we published the book Making Sense of NoSQL.  Ever since then I have advocated for putting the NoSQL content early in any computer science curriculum.</p> <p>My hope is this content helps both teachers and students gain a clear understanding of the variety of different ways we store data and the impact these methods have the competitive nature of the firm.</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>Please contact me on LinkedIn</p> <p>Thanks! - Dan</p>"},{"location":"concepts/document/","title":"Document Databases","text":""},{"location":"concepts/graph/","title":"Graph Databases","text":""},{"location":"concepts/key-value/","title":"Key-Value Databases","text":""},{"location":"concepts/relational/","title":"Relational Databases","text":""}]}
