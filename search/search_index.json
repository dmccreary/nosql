At the start of my career, I was taught that only tabular data structures were the  way to store data.</p> <p>Around the year 2005 I saw an entire generation of new databases appear but I saw very little guidance on how to match a business problem to one of the many new databases.  Working with Tony Shaw at Enterprise Data World (now Dataversity) I created an annual conference to showcase the new database and highlight the core business cases that they were addressing.</p> <p>In 2014, working with my wife, we published the book Making Sense of NoSQL.  Ever since then I have advocated for putting the NoSQL content early in any computer science curriculum.</p> <p>One of the reasons we wrote this book was due to the lack of high-quality books for teaching the process of database selection.  There are many NoSQL books that attempt to write a \"Hello World!\" equivalent using several different databases. Although they may give you the general flavor of how to start using each database, they don't focus on the tradeoffs that solution architects face when selecting a database for a project.  Our book and this content should help you in these reguards.</p> <p>My hope is this content helps both teachers and students gain a clear understanding of the variety of different ways we store data and the impact these methods have the competitive nature of the firm.</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>Please contact me on LinkedIn</p> <p>Thanks! - Dan</p>"},{"location":"glossary/","title":"NoSQL Glossary of Terms","text":""},{"location":"teaching-guide/","title":"Teaching Guide","text":""},{"location":"teaching-guide/#undergraduate-database-course","title":"Undergraduate Database Course","text":"<p>If you are teaching this course to an undergraduate course in databases, you have arrived at the right place.</p> <p>We have worked hard to focus</p>"},{"location":"teaching-guide/#high-school-course","title":"High-School Course","text":""},{"location":"concepts/","title":"Overview of NoSQL Concepts","text":""},{"location":"concepts/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Introduction</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#relational-databases","title":"Relational Databases","text":"<p>Relational Databases</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#analytical","title":"Analytical","text":""},{"location":"concepts/#key-value-stores","title":"Key-Value Stores","text":""},{"location":"concepts/#column-family-stores","title":"Column-Family Stores","text":""},{"location":"concepts/#graph-databases","title":"Graph Databases","text":""},{"location":"concepts/#document-databases","title":"Document Databases","text":""},{"location":"concepts/column-familiy/","title":"Column-Family Databases","text":""},{"location":"concepts/document/","title":"Document Databases","text":""},{"location":"concepts/graph/","title":"Graph Databases","text":""},{"location":"concepts/key-value/","title":"Key-Value Databases","text":""},{"location":"concepts/relational/","title":"Relational Databases","text":""}]}
